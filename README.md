## Note !important
> Role and Techstack filtering has same logic as the stack field present in api.
> For missing min salary, I have used "Upto" keyword and for missing max salary I have used "From" keyword for better user experience. Eg "Upto $ 20K" and "From $10K".
> Sidebar and header is not functional. Used some static texts to replicate the UI.
